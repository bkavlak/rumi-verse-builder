So let it begin!

Three… three… three… one or zero.
Yes, yes, zero.
Wait a minute, let’s check again…

Yes, yes, yes, zero!
Thirty-one or zero.
So thirty. Thirty-one or thirty.

I say let everything begin at this age.
I don’t mean everything — I say everything.

Let everything begin at this age.
My writings, which even I have not looked at in the face,
Strings of words lined up in a row
Adorned with typos and numerical trash.

Is what I have lived anything else?
Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t.
Perhaps in a restless moment
my secret ambitions I once counted will give me away.

I don’t think you’ll wonder who or what I am.
While I myself am exhausted from questioning myself,
at this birthday I’ve sat at thirty or thirty-one times,
I shout at the top of my lungs to write
that I expect nothing from anyone.

Yes, yes, yes. That’s really how it is!
The weather truly is beyond prediction.
Everyone has an opinion about
what’s going on in the realm above months,
but only a few in this world can crack a walnut with their bare hands.

In this world—which, for those who know, is a symbol—
nothing, the nothing that is the opposite of everything,
does not stay as it is!

Yes, yes, it does not stay; the asphalt poured so it would stay in place—
does not stay.
The seven-year-old seated in order—
does not stay.
The nonsense bought from the shop window so it would stay—
does not stay.

This world, enclosed by a sky and somewhere in a void,
some people go around firing off things like swings.
Somewhere in this world I was born,
it’s been thirty or thirty-one years.
No one will remember it all,
no matter how much they claim otherwise.

Ah, this world! Yes, yes, yes…
The oaths I drank forgetting!
All the grains of gas invisible in the sky!
You are there, aren’t you?
You are there…

So let it begin!
